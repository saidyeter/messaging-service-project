# Messaging Service Project

This repository contains an app that is written for messaging. Also contains its dependencies.  

This is an ASP.NET Core Web API application and written in .Net 5.0.  

This app provides sending message and accessing message history by logging in after register.  
*Methods are explained in depth below.*  

Used MongoDB to store message data.  
Used Elastic Search to store logs.
